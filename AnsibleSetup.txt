Setting up Master Ansible/Slave Server

Log into your ansible server and set up a user called ansible. 
This will be the user that uses the Ansible tool to log into all of the other servers to control them, 
so set a strong password and perhaps set up two-factor authentication.

If you want to install via the PPA, youâ€™ll need to enable it and update your  apt  cache
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ansible


Add a user for ansible
sudo adduser ansible

Add ansible user to the sudo user group.
sudo adduser ansible sudo

Create SSH Key
su ansible
ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id  ansible@192.168.25.137

#/etc/sudoers.d/
#nano 90-cloud-init-users
Add below lines to end of 90-cloud-init-users file.
